# ChineseScript
This website decomposes Chinese characters into their components. To use this website enter a character on the homepage and click 'decompose'. Explore the tree of the character's components by clicking on them. 

On this right side of the screen, information will pop up about the component. If a node is blue, this means the component is a phonetic component. The darker it is, the closer it is to the pronunciation of the character. If a node is orange, this means the component is a semantic component and is closely related to the meaning of the character. You can also explore other characters that include each component by clicking on any of the characters under 'some other characters with this component'.
